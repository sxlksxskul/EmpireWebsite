				<h1>What is the ISB?</h1>
				<h5 class="w3-padding-32">The Imperial Security Bureau (ISB), also referred to as the Imperial Security
					Office or the Imperial Secret Service, was a law enforcement and intelligence agency of the Galactic
					Empire that was charged with matters of internal state security and ensuring the loyalty of citizens
					to the Empire.</h5>

				<p>Aside from that, it happened to be one of the many umbrella organizations under the greater
					Commission for the Preservation of the New Order (COMPNOR), and was larger than its sister agency
					Imperial Intelligence. It was led by ISB high command, while the ISB board oversaw certain sectors.
					The Imperial Security Bureau was formed by Galactic Emperor Palpatine as a secret law enforcement
					organization, dedicated to rooting out enemies of the New Order and the Galactic Empire and
					maintaining stability throughout Imperial territories shortly after the proclamation of the New
					Order. Within fourteen years, the organization grew from a handful of agents into an organization
					double the size of Imperial Intelligence. Following the Clone Wars, the agency helped oversee the
					dismantling of Confederate warships and martial supplies. Concurrent loyalty purges saw vast amounts
					of Separatist propaganda destroyed, rescinded, and withheld. Only a handful of propaganda posters
					such as Ansibella Dellu's Count Dooku: Words of Truth escaped the purges. When Art Group agents
					discovered egregious violations of its artistic tenets, agents of the ISB were called in to make
					troublesome artists disappear.</p>

				<p>
					Five years into the Emperor's reign, Imperial Intelligence agents found a cache of communications
					devices on the remote world of Murkhana and referred the case to the ISB, who brought the matter to
					the Emperor and his Imperial Ruling Council. It was ultimately decided to dispatch Moff Wilhuff
					Tarkin and Darth Vader to investigate the cache, which was in reality set up by a small rebel cell,
					despite the ISB hoping to receive full oversight of the investigation from Imperial Intelligence and
					the Naval Intelligence Agency.

					During that same year, the ISB maintained an active operation on the planet Zeffo, a world that was
					of interest to the Emperor's Project Auger. Signs posted by the Bureau on Imperial equipment warned
					residents of a local village that looters of the project would be shot on sight.

							<p>He led the ISB board of Security Bureau personnel on the Imperial capital planet

								their reports, requesting more information from ISB Supervisors Grandi and Lagret before
								defining the ISB as the organization that treated the Empire's disorder. Lonni Jung
								explained why protection requests for traffic to the Abrion sector to Partagaz under the

								sedition in the Imperial Senate. By 14 BBY, the fifth year of the Empire's reign,
								Yularen had been appointed the head liaison between the ISB and its main rival, the
								Naval Intelligence Agency, and was responsible for ensuring cooperation between the

							<h3>Dedra Meero</h3>

							<p>Dedra Meero was a human female who served as a lieutenant and supervisor in the Imperial
								Security Bureau. She was an ISB Supervisor in charge of two sectors, including the
								locations of Steergard and Sev Tok. Following the incident on Ferrix, Meero participated
								in a meeting of ISB supervisors chaired by Major Partagaz. Diligent and methodical, she
								collected and analyzed evidence across the galaxy that indicated an ostensibly more
								organized rebel effort than her superiors suspected. She was also responsible for the
								demise of rebel Anto Kreegyr.</p>
