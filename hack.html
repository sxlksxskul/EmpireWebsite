					<h1>Our REAL Emperor!</h1>

						<p>The origins of Darth Sidious were closely guarded secrets that he took to his grave more than once. He was born on the Mid Rim planet Naboo as Sheev Palpatine, eighty-two years before the Battle of Yavin. The noble Palpatine family belonged to the affluent class in Naboo society, although by the time of the Imperial Era Palpatine did not have a family as far as the public was aware. Palpatine was raised in the cultured city of Theed, his homeworld's capital; he formed connections with a reputable host of credible politicians produced over the centuries, all the while acquiring a great amount of knowledge on governance and the subtleties of power during his youth. As such, Palpatine had been skilled in manipulation since boyhood.</p>

					<p>The details about how Sidious came to study under the Sith were known by very few, with it not even being known of when he did, but he became the Sith apprentice to Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Plagueis and took on the name Darth Sidious. As a Sith Lord, Sidious learned all his Sith Master knew about the dark side of the Force, following the tradition first set by the ancient Darth Bane. While apprenticed to Plagueis, Sidious constructed his own Sith lightsabers. At the same time, little by little, he began to secure political power.</p>

					<p>As a young man, Palpatine had traveled throughout the galaxy, collecting art, at least some of which was connected to the dark side, while doing so. Unaware docents would have written off his collection as junk, but Palpatine knew better. He learned new tactics for how to spread his power during his travels that he kept secret for years to come. While training with Plagueis, Sidious was taught that two Sith were required for their perilous machinations. So, if they worked together in accordance to Darth Bane's Rule of Two, with one of them serving as bait for the dark side of the Force and the other as a vessel, they would succeed in acquiring the ability to harness the full power of the dark side and rule immortal for ten thousand years.</p>

					<p>The Alliance to Restore the Republic (2 BBYâ€“4 ABY), commonly known as the Rebel Alliance, Alliance, the Rebellion, and rarely the Separatists, was a resistance movement formed by Bail Prestor Organa and Mon Mothma to oppose the reign of the Galactic Empire. The Alliance was formed from a less organized movement to oppose the Empire that existed, which was secretly led by Organa. This early group came together from a number of rebel cells, including the crew of the Ghost and the Phoenix Cell. The Atrivis Resistance Group was one of the first cells to join what Mothma began calling "the Alliance" before the formal formation of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The Alliance was publicly and formally declared with the Declaration of the Rebel Alliance.
					</p>

						<p>The Alliance and the cells before it were born from the overall discontent within the Empire of those who wished the Old Republic restored. Its efforts were led by renegade members in the Imperial Senate such as Mon Mothma, Bail Organa, and later, his daughter Leia Organa, and its members were citizens of the Empire and defectors from the Imperial Military such as Jan Dodonna, Ryder Azadi, and Wedge Antilles. Founded and united by Organa and Ahsoka Tano, the early rebels were assisted by surviving Jedi, such as Kanan Jarrus, and his Padawan, Ezra Bridger. Clone Wars veterans such as Captain Rex also assisted in the initial movement.</p>

						<p>As opposed to waging all-out war, the Alliance waged a war of attrition against the Empire, establishing small bases across the galaxy instead of controlling an entire planet.</p>
