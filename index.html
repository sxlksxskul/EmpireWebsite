					<h1>Our Emperor!</h1>
					<h5 class="w3-padding-32">Born on the Mid Rim planet Naboo in 82 BBY during the Republic Era. As a
						result of the
						Invasion of Naboo the Senate elected Palpatine as Supreme
						Chancellor. Following an attempt to
						arrest the chancellor, the Great Jedi Purge commenced with Palpatine enacting Order 66.</h5>

						<p>In 9 BBY, after Vader failed to kill Kenobi during their confrontation on a barren moon, the repaired Sith Lord reached out to his master via a hologram, informing Palpatine he had dispatched probe droids to hunt down Kenobi, adding that his former master would not evade him again. Noticing Vader's agitation, the Emperor questioned his apprentice whether he was affected by his feelings for his former master, suggesting that said feelings had left him weakened. This prompted Vader to affirm that Kenobi meant nothing to him and that he only served the Emperor.</p>

					<p>With the Jedi all but extinct, Palpatine installed the New Order in the
						Republic's place, declaring himself Galactic Emperor and bringing an end to millenia of
						democracy. Not too long after betraying and causing the death of Tyranus, he took on a new
						apprentice, having lured the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to the dark side and transforming him
						into Darth Vader. Their reign was virtually unchallenged for a generation until the formation of
						the Alliance to Restore the Republic. During the Galactic Civil War, the Emperor sought to
						betray Vader, by replacing him with the latter's son, Luke Skywalker. However, Sidious' plan
						backfired when Vader ultimately renounced the dark side and killed Sidious to protect Luke.
						Thus, with the Sith's destruction, the Force was brought back into balance, fulfilling Anakin's
						destiny as the prophesied Chosen One.</p>

					<h1>Our Ideology</h1>
					<h5 class="w3-padding-32">The New Order referred to the political religion and nationalist ideology
						of
						the Empire and the values of which it stood by. Numerous organizations were folded under
						COMPNOR,
						the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order. These included the Imperial Security
						Bureau,
						Coalition for Progress, Imperial Intelligence, and CompForce, along with science divisions and
						youth education initiatives.</h5>

					<p>The Galactic Empire wielded a vast and powerfully effective propaganda machine
						to shift the opinions and cultures of numerous worlds across the galaxy. Celebrating the end of
						the destructive Clone Wars and the creation of the New Order, the Emperor founded Empire Day as
						the
						national holiday of the Empire. The song "Glory of the Empire" served as the national anthem.
						Due to
						physical alterations to Palpatine to make him look younger and more appealing in broadcasts,
						many
						citizens did not know of the Emperor's scarred appearance, nor did they comprehend that the
						galaxy was under the command of a Sith Lord.
						</p>

						<p>To enhance its legitimacy in the eyes of the people, the Empire used the duel in Palpatine's
							office
							to officially support the idea of a "Jedi Rebellion" occurring, and that the Jedi Order had
							attempted to stage a coup intent on taking control of the Republic, thus necessitating Order 66.
							In the years after the proclamation of the New Order, all remaining recordings of the Jedi were
							removed, with many eventually believing and supporting the Emperor's version of events. However,
							individuals such as Zaluna Myder and even Luke Skywalker questioned the Empire's account of the
							events leading up to their destruction, while those who knew the Jedi in person could not bring
							themselves to believe in a Jedi-led coup. Those who attempted to distribute independent
							publications could be punished with imprisonment without term.</p>
