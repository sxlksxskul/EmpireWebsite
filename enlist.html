					<h1>Imperial Lothal Squadron</h1>
					<h5 class="w3-padding-32">After numerous incidents involving rebels (and on some occasions even
						jedi!!!), we have decided to increase our military presence on Lothal to eradicate these
						terrorists and bring peace again to the people of this planet.</h5>

					<p>Lothal was a planet in the Outer Rim Territories. During the early years of the Galactic Empire,
						Lothal was in a state of economic disrepair and invited the Empire to take over the planet's
						industries, with the promise of prosperity and security. Although many people said the Empire
						would bring doom, their attempted insurgency failed, while the Lothalites who preached of new
						jobs and prosperity were vindicated. Amid Lothal's growing strife with the Empire in 5 BBY,
						however, Lothal became the nesting ground for the Spectres, a small rebel cell which operated
						from the starship Ghost. After harrying Imperial forces and disrupting Imperial activities for
						at least a year, the Spectres eventually attracted the attention of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin
						and Darth Vader, who tried unsuccessfully to stamp out these rebels. Vader even imposed a
						blockade on the planet, but the Spectres managed to slip through and rejoin the larger
						rebellion.
					</p>

					<p>A prison revolt led to the escape of several prisoners, including former Governor Ryder Azadi,
						who would go on to start another rebel cell on Lothal. The Imperial blockade would come to cause
						severe hardship and led Princess Leia Organa to undertake a mercy mission to Lothal. However,
						this mission was a ruse for the Organas to deliver ships to the rebellion. In 2 BBY, the ongoing
						rebellion led Azadi's successor, Arihnda Pryce, to invite Grand Admiral Thrawn and his Seventh
						Fleet to establish a presence on Lothal. Ryder's rebel cell's efforts to sabotage Imperial
						vehicles at the Capital City Imperial Armory Complex drew Thrawn's attention.</p>

					<h1>Imperial Navy</h1>
					<h5 class="w3-padding-16">The Imperial Navy is currently expanding its forces in order to ensure
						better protection to Imperial planets due to increase in recent rebel activity. Exceptional
						applicants will be sent to a top secret space station in order to increase tis security.</h5>

					<p>With the rise of the New Order, the massive military buildup that became synonymous with the late
						Galactic Republic in an effort to combat the Separatist Alliance in the Clone Wars was continued
						and expanded in the now Galactic Empire. When the Separatist leadership was executed at Mustafar
						by the Sith Lord Darth Vader; then Supreme Chancellor Palpatine announced his plans for the
						galaxy since the beginning. He thus officially wiped away the thousand year old Republic by
						proclaiming the creation of the Galactic Empire, with himself as its Galactic Emperor.</br>

						After the rise of the New Order, the Imperial Navy was created from the remains of the Republic
						Navy at the end of the Clone Wars, and inherited its proud naval tradition that dated back
						thousands of years. It came to have its own starships that patrolled the vast majority of
						Imperial space throughout the reign of Emperor Palpatine's New Order. After the establishment of
						the Imperial Navy, it became the primary projection of the Imperial Military's arm, becoming the
						largest branch in the Armed Forces with its enormous fleet of vessels and millions of personnel.
					</p>

					<p>Almost immediately, any reminders of the Old Republic were removed, with the Grand Army of the
						Republic renamed the Imperial Army and Republic Navy reorganized as the Imperial Navy. The
						distinctive red coloring of Venator-class Star Destroyers were almost immediately painted a more
						subdued grey, along with the eventual uniform and equipment upgrades for the countless men and
						women in the Imperial Military. In the days following the proclamation of the New Order, the
						Imperial Navy would continue to utilize the popular Republic-era Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing
						starfighters along with the mass produced Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighter, while Lord
						Vader would receive his own black Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor until he would eventually
						pilot his much improved TIE Advanced x1 which first saw usage during the Siege of Lothal four
						years prior to the Battle of Yavin.</p>

					<h1>Imperial Pilots</h1>
					<h5 class="w3-padding-16">Imperial pilots are always in demand, as they not only operate in space,
						but also on all Imperial occupated planets. Training for becoming a pilot can be harsh and very
						strict, but it is all needed to ensure you learn all the right skills.</h5>

					<p>TIE pilots served in the Starfighter Corps of the Imperial Navy by piloting the various TIE
						Series starfighters. Distinguished by all-black flight suits and bulky, fully enclosed,
						vacuum-sealed helmets, the Galactic Empire at its height produced millions of TIE pilots and
						generally considered them expendable assets. The TIE pilots formed the elite of the Imperial
						Navy's Flight Branch.
						They were referred to as "bucketheads" by Rebel pilots, due to their bulky helmets. Within the
						Imperial forces they were often referred to as "coffin jockeys" due to the high mortality rate
						of those manning the vulnerable TIE fighters, a holdover from the Galactic Republic's use of
						clones during the Clone Wars prior to the Empire's formation.</p>

					<p>The first generation of TIE pilots was composed of clones, survivors of the clone trooper pilots
						of the Republic Starfighter Corps from the Clone Wars. This early use of clones was one of the
						main reasons why TIE pilots were often viewed as expendable and given little protection during
						combat.
						Even early into the Empire, however, there were several Imperial officers who campaigned to have
						the various TIE fighters redesigned to protect the pilots better, largely because non-clone
						Human pilots from the Imperial Academy began to replace and outnumber the aging clone trooper
						veterans. However, these were ignored by the Imperial Navy's hierarchy, and notably were
						dismissed by the pilots themselves. The TIE pilots believed that their lack of protection was a
						testament to their skills rather than the Empire's view of them as disposable. This notoriously
						callous treatment of pilots was such that the TIE fighter, in addition to representing the
						technological might of the Empire, was also symbolic of the Empire's disregard for its own
						soldiers.</p>

					<h1>Imperial Royal Guard</h1>
					<h5 class="w3-padding-16">Do you have what it takes to protect the most important person in this
						galaxy, our Emperor? If you think you do, why not join his trusted Royal Guards and prove it?
						Only the best of the best have the honor of holding the title of Crimson Guard. The Emperor
						himself personally oversees training of this branch.</h5>

					<p>The origins of the crimson-clad Royal Guard dated back to the time of the Separatist Crisis, when
						Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine crafted an order of protectors, named the Red Guard, that
						stood apart from the cerulean-clad Senate Guard during the Galactic Republic's twilight. Over
						the course of the Clone Wars, the Red Guard gradually supplanted the Senate Guard and its elite
						sub-unit, the Senate Commandos, as the chancellor's bodyguards. By the end of the Clone Wars,
						Palpatine proclaimed himself Emperor of the Galactic Empire. As a result, Senate Guards were
						completely phased out of service and replaced by the chancellor's Red Guards, who were
						henceforth known as the Royal Guard. </br>
						Emperor Palpatine sealed himself away from the populace throughout his reign. On the rare
						occasions of his public appearances, he was always accompanied by members of the Royal Guard. In
						the decades that followed Palpatine's death and the subsequent fall of the Empire at the Battle
						of Jakku, a new order of protectors was crafted by Supreme Leader Snoke of the First Order.
						Modeled on the Emperor's Royal Guard, the Elite Praetorian Guard consisted of eight warriors who
						wore ornate crimson armor, wielded an array of melee weapons, and specialized in martial arts,
						such as Teräs Käsi. Likewise, the reborn Emperor Palpatine revived his employment of
						crimson-clad guardsmen through the Sovereign Protectors, selected from the finest Sith troopers
						the Sith Eternal had readied.</p>

					<p>The Emperor's Royal Guards were reputedly the most skilled warriors in the forces of the Galactic
						Empire; out of millions of soldiers, Emperor Palpatine's guards were unsurpassed in skill and
						status. During the era of the Empire, the Royal Guard consisted of conscripts and at least one
						clone trooper. The qualifications for joining the Guard's ranks included strength, intelligence,
						and loyalty. Candidates for the Guard had to meet the basic height requirement of 1.83 meters.

					<h1>Scout Trooper Corps</h1>
					<h5 class="w3-padding-16">The scout trooper corps are currently recruiting new soldiers to serve on
						the planet of Endor. We have great interest inn this planet and need your help in order to

					<p>
						Succeeding the clone scout troopers of the Galactic Republic, scout troopers served as a
						reconnaissance force for the Galactic Empire. They were trained for more independence and
						adaptability than other Imperial troops. Scout troopers were often stationed at Imperial bases,
						cities, planets, and other points of interest. A famous example is the Death Star's shield
						generator on Endor. Utilizing speeder bikes, scout troopers patrolled Imperial areas,
						maintaining law and order and looking out for possible attackers. This is how they get their
						nickname of "biker scouts." Scout troopers may also be seen patrolling areas on foot, as seen on
						planets like Endor and Vardos.</p>

					<p>Scout troopers fulfilled their reconnaissance role in other ways as well. They were often sent to
						scout out enemies during a battle to gain information to report back to their commander.
						Similarly, they may be sent on a reconnaissance mission to gain information on an individual or
						group when there isn't a current battle going on. Scout troopers also may be tasked with an
						espionage mission, getting behind enemy lines and gaining secret information. All three of these
						types of reconnaissance missions may be long term. Also within their ranks were the sniper
						troopers, who utilized long range rifles for a wide variety of missions. Sniper troopers may
						provide long range cover for stormtroopers during a mission. Sniper troopers may also be sent on
						similar reconnaissance missions, so if necessary, they can take out key targets from a distance.
