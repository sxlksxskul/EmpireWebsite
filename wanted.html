				<h5 class="w3-padding-16">The Rules Of Self-Defence</h5>

				<p>Self-defence is not some fun boxing match. It is about escaping with your life. The three key rules
					are as follows: </p>
				<ul class="w3-ul w3-hoverable">
					<li>Strike - You always want to strike your attacker first in order to disorient them while
						simultaneously giving you a chance to escape.</li>
					<li>Scream - Make sure you scream in order to alert other people in the area around you to either
						come to your aid, or let them know to get to safety also.</li>
					<li>Run - Make a run for it. If possible, locate the nearest Stormtrooper in the area or any other
						imperial security and let them know about the danger. If that is not a possibility, run as far
						as you can and find a safe location to hide, or leave the area entirely. If you are still in the
						area hiding, locate a weeapon to defend yourself with, but use it only if necessary.</li>

						on the planet Fest, and settled with his adopted family, including the droid B2EMO, on the Free

					<h5 class="w3-padding-32">Wanted for multiple war crimes which include: targeting civilians,

						terrorism, theft, murder, ....</h5>

					<p>Saw Gerrera was a human male Onderonian resistance fighter who, as a leading member of the
						Onderon rebels, fought against the Confederacy of Independent Systems on Onderon during the
						Clone Wars. Alongside his sister, Steela Gerrera, Gerrera was instrumental in the rebel
						liberation of their homeworld during the Onderonian Civil War. Following the rise of the
						Galactic Empire at the end of the war, Saw became a key member in the fight against the fascist
						government and the formation of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. His tactics during the
						early rebellion against the Empire led him to be seen as an extremist, one whose notoriety was
						recognized by both the Empire, the Alliance, and, many years later, the New Republic.</p>

					<p>Gerrera fought against the Imperial Military and led a resistance group known as the Partisans, a
						militant organization that some considered an extremist organization with terrorism tactics, and
						operated under the codename, "Stoneface." His resistance cell, a continuation of his Onderonian
						resistance, was one of the first in the group of cells that formed the Rebel Alliance. He was
						later involved in the early campaigns of the Rebel Alliance, by which time his more-extreme
						tactics had come to stand in stark contrast with those of Alliance leaders Bail Organa and Mon
						Mothma. Gerrera eventually cut ties with Organa and Mothma, who viewed him as a militant and
						extremist.</p>

					<h1>Darth Maul</h1>
					<h5 class="w3-padding-16">Leader of the crime organization known as the Crimson Dawn</h5>

					<p>Maul was a Force-sensitive Dathomirian Zabrak male who established himself as a crime lord during
						the reign of the Galactic Empire. He was once known as Darth Maul when he was the apprentice of
						Darth Sidious, and therefore, a Dark Lord of the Sith. Having trained in the ways of the Force,
						Darth Maul was a formidable warrior strong with the dark side and possessed deadly skills in
						lightsaber combat. In addition, he was a scheming mastermind who plotted his return to power
						despite losing his place in the ranks of the Sith.</p>

					<p>Sometime after his escape during the Purge, Maul had once again returned to Dathomir where he
						took up residence, and became the shadowy leader of Crimson Dawn, with Dryden Vos as his
						figurehead. During his time as leader of Crimson Dawn, Maul began a search for an ancient Sith
						holocron. While searching, Maul used a tactic of stealth, wearing a hooded cloak to hide his
						appearance and exchanged his double-bladed lightsaber for another one which he added a wooden
						part to in order to give it the appearance of a staff. </br>
						In 10 BBY, following Vos's death, Maul was contacted by his underling Qi'ra, who informed him
						that Vos had been betrayed and murdered by Tobias Beckett and his associates that he employed,
						before having his shipment of coaxium stolen while it was being refined on the desert planet
						Savareen.</p>

					<p>Irritated, Maul recalled Qi'ra to Dathomir, where he said that the two would decide how best to
						deal with Beckett and the other traitors. He then activated his new lightsaber and told Qi'ra
						that they would be working more closely from then on, elevating her to the late Vos's
						position. Maul taught Qi'ra about the Sith Order, revealing to her on his mutterings the
						Rule of Two, he told her that Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine was actually the Dark Lord of the
						Sith known as Darth Sidious and that the Imperial enforcer Darth Vader was his Sith apprentice.
						Maul told her about his plan to use Crimson Dawn to take down the Empire. He also trained Qi'ra
						to fight the Sith.</p>

					<h1>Ezra Bridger</h1>
					<h5 class="w3-padding-32">Wanted for: theft, arsony, treason, conspiring with rebels, impersonating
						an Imperial cadet, hijacking, trespassing, ....</h5>

					<p>Ezra Bridger, a Force-sensitive human male, was a Jedi Padawan, a freedom fighter, and a
						revolutionary leader in the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire. He was born on Empire
						Day in 19 BBY to Ephraim and Mira Bridger. His parents' public criticism of the Empire led to
						their imprisonment, leaving Bridger an orphan on the planet Lothal as a child. He joined the
						rebel crew of the Ghost in 5 BBY and was trained in the ways of the Force by Kanan Jarrus. With
						a particular connection to nature and other living beings, Bridger's abilities grew quickly, and
						a message of hope he broadcast in the Lothal sector inspired a number of rebel cells to begin
						working together to fight the Empire..</p>

					<p>In 4 BBY, Bridger learned that his parents were killed while attempting to escape from prison.
						The young Jedi, already having struggled with his dark side, became more conflicted, coming to a
						head on the ancient Sith world of Malachor where he recovered a Sith holocron in the hopes of
						destroying the Sith. He also encountered the former Sith Lord Maul, who hoped to make Bridger
						his apprentice—particularly once Bridger used the dark side to open the holocron. This briefly
						strained his apprenticeship with Jarrus, who was blinded by Maul on Malachor, but the two
						repaired their relationship and continued to progress as Jedi.</p>

					<p>With his powers growing stronger, especially his natural skill at communicating with other living
						beings, Bridger took on more leadership roles in the rebellion, including helping Captain
						CT-7567 "Rex" and a surviving battalion of Separatist Alliance battle droids make peace and
						bring a sense of closure to the unresolved Clone Wars. Bridger also came into conflict with
						Grand Admiral Thrawn, helped fellow crewmate Sabine Wren in her quest to reunite the Mandalorian
						people, and sought to find Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, whom Bridger believed was key to
						destroying the Sith.</p>

					<p>In 0 BBY, Bridger managed to free his people from the Empire's control during the Liberation of
						Lothal. Towards the end of the battle, he and Thrawn were taken into hyperspace by the purrgil.
						This opening allowed the Lothal resistance group on the ground to free the planet by destroying
						the Imperial dome. After the fall of the Empire, Wren and Ahsoka Tano set off on a journey to
						find Bridger and bring him home.</p>

					<h1>Clone Force 99 (alias: The Bad Batch)</h1>
					<h5 class="w3-padding-16">Wanted for insubordination and refusal to execute order 66. Members include: Hunter, Crosshair, Tech, Wrecker, Echo, Omega</h5>

					<p>The Bad Batch, formerly known as Clone Force 99, and designated as Experimental Unit Clone Force 99, was a clone commando special forces squad that was active during the Clone Wars. The squad initially consisted of four clone commandos that were designed with genetic mutations and led by Clone Sergeant "Hunter," a clone with enhanced sensory abilities. Other members of the squad included CT-9904 "Crosshair," a clone with keen eyesight and marksmanship that allowed him to excel in long-distance firefights, "Wrecker," a reckless clone with an enhanced muscular form, and "Tech," a clone with enhanced mental capacity and intelligence. Following the crucial Battle of Anaxes, Advanced Recon Commando Clone Corporal CT-1409 "Echo" joined the unit.
					</p>

					<p>
						Most of the members' mutations and the ordeal Echo suffered prior to joining caused their inhibitor chips to have less effect, meaning Clone Force 99 was able to disobey Order 66, at least at first, while they were fighting in the Conquest of Kaller, and Hunter helped Jedi Padawan Caleb Dume escape the other clones by lying about his death. However, unlike the rest of the team, Crosshair was affected by his chip, attempting to kill Dume during the incident. In the aftermath, as the Galactic Republic became the Galactic Empire, the Bad Batch's loyalty was questioned by Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin. He sent them on a mission to eliminate a group of insurgents, but as the squad found out, that was not what was happening. After the squad disobeyed orders to kill civilians and former Republic fighters during a mission to Onderon, all of the squad's members save Crosshair deserted from the Empire, taking with them Omega, a young experimental female clone they met on Kamino. Now fugitives from the Empire, they eventually came to work as mercenaries for the information broker Cid in the early Imperial Era.
